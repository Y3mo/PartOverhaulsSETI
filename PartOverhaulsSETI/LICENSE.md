This is a simple adjustment of the configs of the original Porkjet PartOverhauls, to make them fit into the base game when used as an add on mod (instead of replacing the stock parts).
For this reason, the part titles are differentiated from the stock parts. Furthermore the upgrades are removed, since part upgrading is currently badly implemented.
Instead, the part stats and tech tree positions are adjusted to make them into improved versions of the stock parts.
This also makes the parts relevant when VenStockRevamp is used to replace the stock parts.
